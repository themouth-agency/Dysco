## 🎉 **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS**

### ✅ **Merchant-Centric Architecture Complete**
We've successfully implemented a **production-ready, merchant-initiated coupon creation flow**:

1. **🏪 Merchant Experience**: Complete separation with dedicated merchant interface
2. **🔐 Security**: Merchant signs transactions on their device with biometric auth
3. **💰 Fee Abstraction**: Merchants pay fiat, we handle all HBAR fees
4. **🎯 Real NFTs**: Actual Hedera testnet NFT minting with proper HIP-412 metadata
5. **⚡ Performance**: Frontend signing + backend validation + operator co-signing

This architecture is **exactly what a real production system would use**!

### ✅ **Campaign Management Strategy**
**Decision: One NFT Collection Per Merchant + Campaign Metadata**

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ **Better brand ownership** - merchants control their collection
- ✅ **Lower gas costs** - fewer collection creation transactions  
- ✅ **Simpler management** - all merchant coupons in one place
- ✅ **Campaign flexibility** via rich NFT metadata properties

**Campaign Properties in NFT Metadata:**
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "campaign": "Summer2025",
    "campaignType": "percentage", 
    "validFrom": "2025-06-01",
    "validUntil": "2025-08-31",
    "maxUsesPerCustomer": 1,
    "targetAudience": "all",
    "totalLimit": 1000
  }
}
```

**Campaign Types Supported:**
- `percentage` - "20% off"
- `fixed_amount` - "$5 off"  
- `bogo` - "Buy one get one"
- `free_shipping` - Free delivery
